                    In the Assignment of Title by Owner or similar section, any fields that require information about the seller/owner/transferer are asking for information about you. When the title asks for the seller's name you would either print or sign your name exactly as it appears on the title where you are listed as the owner. Most states require that all owners listed on the title must print and sign their name when transferring ownership.
                    Any fields that require information about a buyer/purchaser/transferee are asking for information about the person you are selling or donating the vehicle to. This section should never, under any circumstances, be left completely blank as this can lead to abuses and liability for you.</p>"
