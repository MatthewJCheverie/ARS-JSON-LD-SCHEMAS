                  <p><span>Donating your vehicle to your favorite charity takes only 3 easy steps! Unlike other car donation companies, Car Donation Wizard makes the <a href=https://www.cardonationwizard.com/how-it-works/>process</a> quick and simple. To donate your vehicle, <a href=https://www.cardonationwizard.com/all-charities/>choose your charity</a>, tell us a bit about yourself and your vehicle, and schedule your pick-up! That’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p>2. <b>Transparency</b></p>
                  <p><span>Car Donation Wizard is proud to accept both running and non-running vehicles. And guess what? Your vehicle can be new, lightly used, or in the end-of-life stage. Whatever you donate, rest assured that we will deliver the optimal amount of cash to your chosen charity, AND that your donation will make a positive difference on the environment!&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p>3.<b> Return to Charity&nbsp;</b></p>
                  <p><span>Most car donation programs operate under a veil of secrecy by not disclosing business practices and misrepresenting sales proceeds. Car Donation Wizard is a service of Advanced Remarketing Services. Unlike many other car donation programs where 70% of net is returned to charity, Car Donation Wizard delivers <strong>75-80% of every gross dollar</strong> to the charity of your choice.&nbsp;</span></p>

                  In the “assignment of title by owner” or similar section, any fields that require information about the seller/owner/transferor are asking for information about you. When the title asks for the sellers name you would either print or sign your name exactly as it appears on the title where you are listed as the owner. Most states require that all owners listed on the title must print and sign their name when transferring ownership.
                  
                  Any fields that require information about a buyer/purchaser/transferee are asking for information about the person you are selling or donating the vehicle to. This section should never, under any circumstances, be left completely blank as this can lead to abuses and liability for you.
